# 👋 Hola Nerds

⛷️ I hope you're having a good day

👀 I enjoy using computers to create things that make life easier. The first computer I worked on was an Apple IIe in kindergarten, I loved the way the keys on those old mechanical keyboards clicked loudly under your fingers.

💞️ I like to work with anyone that's willing to code something with me. I like my work to be original, simple, and make sense in the real world.

🐦 In an effort to not bore you to death with tech-talk, here are some non-techy related things about me!
