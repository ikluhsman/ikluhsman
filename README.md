# 👋 Hola Nerds!

### ⛷️ I hope you're having a good day!

👀 I enjoy using computers to create things that make life more enjoyable. I believe that solving problems using computers accelerates the evolution of human beings. The first computer I worked on was an Apple IIe in kindergarten, I loved the way the keys on those old keyboards clicked loudly under your fingers.

🌱 During High School I was hired for a computer tech job at a Cancer Research Center while working on an Associate's degree in Computer Information Systems. After I got my degree I started working at a Managed Services company, and I quickly realized that the "business" end of computing isn't really my cup of tea, I found that coding is more what I am passionate about.

## #️⃣ So I learned to code. 

💻 As I worked through the ranks I strived to become a leader and creator in the Managed Services Industry. In the beginning I enjoyed surprising my team with a cool thing that made everyone's lives easier. I came out on the other side as a full-stack developer with expertise in cloud computing and large-scale managed IT services platforms.

💞️ I like to work with anyone that's willing to code something with me. I enjoy building my own ideas and projects, and I realize that is an ongoing thing I'll continue to do for the rest of my days. I enjoy seeing my vision come together as a complete idea, but I've come to realize that no code is ever truly finished. It is rather is always a part of a larger scheme in the coding world. So I really love contributing to other projects as well. I like my work to be original, simple, and make sense in the real world.

🐦 Whew! So in an effort to not bore you to death with tech-talk, here are some non-work related things about me!
