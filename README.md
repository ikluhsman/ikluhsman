# 👋 Hola Nerds!

⛷️ I hope you're having a good day!

👀 I enjoy using computers to create things that make life more enjoyable. I believe that solving problems using computers accelerates the evolution of human beings. The first computer I worked on was an Apple IIe in kindergarten, we did typing tutors and I loved the way the keys on those old keyboards clicked loudly under your fingers.

🌱 During High School I started out with a computer tech job at a Cancer Research Center while getting an Associate's degree in business and Computer Information Systems. After I got my degree I started working at a Managed Services company, and I quickly realized that the business end of computing isn't really my cup of tea. I am actually more of an introvert than I seem to be at face value, and I found that coding was more what I am passionate about. As I worked through the ranks I strived to become a leader and creator in the Managed Services Industry, as I moved through many positions to help grow the Managed Services Business. In the beginning I enjoyed creating something new and then surprising my team with something that made everyone's lives easier. I came out on the other side as a full-stack .NET developer writing Remote Access and Management software.

💞️ I like to work with anyone that's willing to code something with me. Recently I find that I enjoy writing code for myself and my own projects, and I realize that this is an ongoing thing I'll continue to do for the rest of my days. I enjoy writing code that I makes sense to other people, and can be seen as useful at least to me. I have found that JavaScript is one of my favorite tools to help achieve this.
