# 👋 Hola Nerds!

⛷️ I hope you're having a good day!

👀 I enjoy using computers to create things that make life more enjoyable. I have worked in the IT industry as a Principal Engineer for over 15 years in Denver, Colorado.

🌱 I’m currently working for Technicom Corporation as a Principal Engineer, as well as doing freelance work for local clients where I live in Denver. Right I code a lot in web app frameworks such as Nuxt.js and Vue.js. Every project has different needs when it comes to choice of framework and coding languages, so I'm flexible and can build in other frameworks too. I enjoy learning new ways to build applications so I spend a good amount of time on UDemy and reading through API guides.

💞️ I’d like to work with anyone that's willing to code something with me. I miss the days of working on a real software team, my new job is fairly lonely in that regard.

🐦 Here are some non-work related things about me.

📫 You can contact me, send me an email at iankluhsman@gmail.com. I love to hear from other developers and make friends that share a common interest in my hobbies.

🍻 Cheers!
