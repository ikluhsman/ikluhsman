# 👋 Hola Nerds!

### ⛷️ I hope you're having a good day!

👀 I enjoy using computers to create things that make life more enjoyable. I believe that solving problems using computers accelerates the evolution of human beings. The first computer I worked on was an Apple IIe in kindergarten, I loved the way the keys on those old keyboards clicked loudly under your fingers.

🌱 During High School I was hired for a computer tech job at a Cancer Research Center while working on an Associate's degree in Business and Computer Information Systems. After I got my degree I started working at a Managed Services company, and I quickly realized that the "business" end of computing isn't really my cup of tea. I am actually more of an introvert than I seem to be at face value, and I found that coding is more what I am passionate about.

## #️⃣ So I learned to code. 

As I worked through the ranks I strived to become a leader and creator in the Managed Services Industry. In the beginning I enjoyed surprising my team with a cool thing that made everyone's lives easier. I came out on the other side as a full-stack .NET developer with expertise in products and applications serving many industries.

💞️ I like to work with anyone that's willing to code something with me. I have found that I enjoy writing code for myself and my own projects, and I realize that this is an ongoing thing I'll continue to do for the rest of my days. I enjoy seeing my vision come together as a finished project, and I enjoy creating things from the ground-up, rather than using something like a CMS. I like my work to be original, simple, and make sense in the real world. I have found that JavaScript is one of my favorite tools to help achieve this.
