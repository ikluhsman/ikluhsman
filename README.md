👋 Hola Nerds!

⛷️ I hope you're having a good day.

👀 I enjoy using computers to create things that make life more enjoyable. I have worked in the Information Technology industry for over 15 years in Denver, Colorado.

🌱 I’m currently learning Nuxt.js and Vue.js and a wide variety of CSS and javascript frameworks in my spare time. I spend a lot of time on UDemy picking up new skills that I can use on my secret personal projects.

💞️ I’d like to work with anyone that's willing to code something with me. I miss the days of working on a real software team, my new job is fairly lonely in that regard.

📫 You can contact me! Send me an email at iankluhsman@gmail.com.

🍻 Cheers!
